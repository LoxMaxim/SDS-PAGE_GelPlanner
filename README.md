This tool allows you to plan out gels of different sizes (10-, 15-, and 26-wells).
You can specify sample name, type and volume for each lane and save the eventual lay-out as an image.

To use this tool go to: https://loxmaxim.github.io/SDS-PAGE_GelPlanner/

Downloading an image doesn't work in chrome-based browsers.
